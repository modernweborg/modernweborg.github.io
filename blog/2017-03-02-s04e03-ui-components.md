Benoit Marchant, create of the Montage Framework, and Andy Matuschak, UIKit engineer, researcher and head of mobile engineering at Khan Academy, join us to discuss UI components. We reminisce Benoit and Andy’s extensive history of web and native engineering at Apple. We debate various challenges and best practices of component reusability, encapsulation, gestures, data binding, and collaboration between engineers and designers.
