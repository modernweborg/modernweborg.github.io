In this episode of the Modern Web podcast - Ben Lesh stars as the Jerry Springer of JavaScript stirs things up with the Polymer team Monica Dinculescu and Fred Schott with hard questions about louder voices representing Polymer on twitter and the reasoning behind perceived abrasiveness.

Thankfully, no one gets pregnant in this episode and hard conversations are all in jest. The meat of this podcast is centered around the difference between Polymer and web components, composable components nested inside svg, where browsers are in supporting native custom elements, web components versus frameworks, the concept of using the platform, using Polymer in frameworks like Angular 2, the progression of the polymer-cli.
